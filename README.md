# Standardized Emission and Waste Inventories (StEWI)

StEWI is a collection of Python modules that provide processed USEPA emission and waste generation inventory data in standard tabular formats.
 The standard outputs may be further aggregated or filtered based on given criteria, and can be combined based on common facility and flows
  across the inventories.

StEWI consists of a core module, `stewi`, that digests and provides the USEPA inventory data in standard formats. Two matcher modules, the `facilitymatcher`
and `chemicalmatcher`, provide commons IDs for facilities and flows across inventories, which is used by the `stewicombo` module
to combine the data, and optionally remove overlaps and remove double counting of groups of chemicals based on user preferences.

## USEPA Inventories Covered By Data Reporting Year (current version)

## Standard output formats

The core `stewi` module produces the following output formats:

[Flow-By-Facility](./format%20specs/FlowByFacility.md): Each row represents the total amount of release or waste of a single type in a given year from the given facility.

[Flow-By-SCC](./format%20specs/FlowBySCC.md): Each row represents the total amount of release or waste of a single type in a given year from the given facility for each source classification code (SCC).

[Facility](./format%20specs/Facility.md): Each row represents a unique facility in a given inventory and given year

[Flow](./format%20specs/Flow.md):  Each row represents a unique flow (substance or waste) in a given inventory and given year

The `chemicalmatcher` module produces:

[Chemical Matches](./format%20specs/ChemicalMatches.md): Each row provides a common identifier for an inventory flow chemical

The `facilitymatcher` module produces:

[Facility Matches](./format%20specs/FacilityMatches.md): Each row provides a common identifier for an inventory facility

The `stewicombo` module produces:

[Flow-By-Facility Combined](./format%20specs/FlowByFacilityCombo.md): Analagous to the flowbyfacility, with chemical and facilitymatches added
